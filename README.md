# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Netflix-Reviews

In this project a Neural Network model based on Recurrent Neural Networks aims to predict whether a Netflix review conveys a positive or a negative sentiment. For each review the model predicts a percentage value for conveying a particular sentiment.

In case of Recurrent Neural Network I am using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTMs) networks. Via input arguments the user can specify whether these LSTMs should be bi-directional or uni-directional. A Dropout wrapper around the LSTMs prevents the overfitting.
